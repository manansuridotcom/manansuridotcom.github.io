Hi, I'm Manan ðŸ‘‹

I am a Computer Engineering undergraduate at `Netaji Subhas University of Technology`, New Delhi. My academic journey has been marked by consistent excellence, earning me the prestigious CVSPK Scholar distinction, placing me consistenly within the top 5% of my cohort.

With a keen interest in AI, Data, and Software, I've embarked on a dynamic professional journey that reflects my passion and dedication. One of my recent achievements includes serving as a `Data Science for Social Good Fellow` at the `University of Warwick` during the summer of 2023. Collaborating closely with the [Algorithmic Transparency Institute](https://ati.io/), I delved into the critical domain of greenwashing and greenmessaging. Working alongside luminaries like [Dr. Geoffrey Supran](https://people.miami.edu/profile/19dbd62ef7e2e5fcd155ef0c53f35bc8) from the University of Miami and [Dr. John Cook](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/1028119-john-cook) from the University of Melbourne, I contributed to fostering transparency in this pivotal area.

I've also had the privilege to contribute meaningfully to the startup landscape, particularly at the dynamic startup [Scalenut](https://www.scalenut.com/). In this role, I had the opportunity to harness the capabilities of Language Model technologies, working on tasks such as document ranking and retrieval functions. One notable accomplishment was my involvement in creating a high-performing fact annotator, a modest contribution that aimed to enhance the startup's offerings.

Research has been a cornerstone of my journey, and I've had the privilege of collaborating with distinguished minds in academia. At `Northeastern University`, I worked alongside [Dr. Divya Dabas Chaudhary](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/people/divya-chaudhary/) and [Dr. Ian Gorton](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/people/ian-gorton/), managing and guiding four research teams. Together, we delved into crucial areas such as Depressive Tendencies, Trigger Warnings, and Fine-grained Sexism Detection.

My research endeavors extended to the `MIDAS Lab at IIIT Delhi`, where, under the guidance of [Dr. Rajiv Ratan Shah](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/rajivratn), I explored the intricate interplay of speech disfluency, conversational context, and user history for the vital task of hate speech detection.

Currently, I am privileged to be under the mentorship of [Dr. Dinesh Manocha](https://www.cs.umd.edu/people/dmanocha) at the `GAMMA Lab, University of Maryland, College Park`. My current works encompass Implicit Hate Speech, pioneering Data Augmentation techniques for Low Resource Complex Named Entity Recognition, and the innovative realm of text-guided document editing.
